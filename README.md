# hello-world
I'm new here.s
My name is Victoria...a graduate of the university with a bachelor's degree in finance and banking.
I love tech and developed a sudden interest for it.
I'm a beginner in frontend development. I'm looking forward to learn and connect with everyone to help train me so we deliver great works all over the world.

The reason for the changes is that I wanted to keep it short but I want you all to know me better.
